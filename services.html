            <img class="image" src="crop-select2.jpg">
            <ol>
                <li>Comparative pricing of different crops. For some crops government releases prices of the crop at
                    the
                    time of seeding.</li>
                <li>Market demand and sale potential of the crop.</li>
                <li>Budget required for the cultivation of each crop.</li>

            </ol>
            <p>By selecting the right crop for given conditions, one can optimise the requirement of irrigation
                water
                and added fertiliser and increase yields.

                The crop water needs mainly depend on:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The climate</li>
                <li>The crop type</li>
                <li>The growth stage</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>The Climate</h3>
            <p>
                In a sunny and hot climate, crops need more water per day than in a cloudy and cool climate. One has
                to
                consider the amount of rainfall and water loss trough percolation and evapotranspiration in order to
                calculate the right amount of irrigation water needed. Soil moisture conservation through mulching,
                tillage techniques, soil cover or soil amendment.
            </p>
            <h3>The Crop Type</h3>
            <p>
                <u>climatic zone</u><br><br>
                There exist crops like rice or sugarcane, which need more water than crops like beans and wheat. The
                table below gives some idea about the different seasonal water needs of the most important field
                crops.

            <h3>The Growing Stage</h3>
            <img class="image" src="crop-select3.jpg">
            <p>fully-grown crop will need more water than a crop that has just been planted. It is estimated that
                50% of
                the crop water is needed during the mid-season stage, when the crop is fully developed. During the
                so-called crop development stage the crop water need gradually increases to the maximum crop water
                need
                (100%). The maximum crop water need is reached at the end of the crop development stage, which is
                the
                beginning of the mid-season stage.</p>
            <p>Fresh harvested crops, such as lettuce, cabbage, etc. need the same amount of water during the late
                season stage as during the mid-season stage. The crops are harvested fresh and thus they need water
                up
                to the last moment.</p>
            <p>Dry harvested crops, such as cotton, maize (for grain production), sunflower, etc. are allowed to dry
                out
                and sometimes even die during the late season stage these crops. Thus their water needs during the
                late
                season stage are minimal.</p>
